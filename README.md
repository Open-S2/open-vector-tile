## About

The Open Vector Tile specification is a Tile format for storing GIS data. The `Vector` in the name has become something of a misnomer. This spec and its code are no longer limited to vector data but also supports gridded data and image data inside the same tile.

This also serves as a modified TypeScript implementation of the [Mapbox Vector Tile](https://github.com/mapbox/vector-tile-js) library. So it is backwards compatible but offers a lot of new features and improvements including (but not limited to):

* üîó lightweight zero dependency builds.
* üå¥ Proper module treeshake.
* ü¶∫ Complete TypeScript support / safety.
* üóú Pre-Tessellated & Indexed geometries to quickly ship data to the renderer.
* üßä Support for 3D geometries.
* ‚ôè Support for M-Values for each geometry point (used by lines and polygons).
* ‚ôªÔ∏è Feature Properties & M-Values are stored as "Shapes" which reuses objects only needing to do lookups on values.
* üèõ Column encoding of data to make it more compact. Better gzip and brotli compression.
* ü™∫ Support nested objects in properties and m-values.
* üì¶ All features support first class citizen `BBOX` data like IDs.
* ü´• Lines and Polygons support `offsets` to know the distance it's traveled (useful for correctly rendering dashed lines across tiles).
* üì∑ Supports storing multiple images in the tile.
* üßá Supports multiple of any gridded data such as `elevation`, `temperature`, `precipitation`, etc.

## Inspirations

A very talented [Markus Tremmel](https://github.com/mactrem) came up with the idea of migrating away from a row based approach to a column based approach with his [COVTiles](https://github.com/mactrem/cov-tiles). I wanted to test the idea of simplifying his project and see if it was worth the effort. Once I saw brotli compression had comperable results, I decided to finish the project.

## Motivations

Since another spec is being built at the same time, you may think this is a waste of time or creating an unnecessary conflict of interest. [So I wrote my thoughts on this topic and why this spec is being created](/motivation.md).

## Read The Spec

The first iteration is up. It needs to be revised for more clarity, but includes all the concepts:

[open-vector-tile-spec](/vector-tile-spec/1.0.0/README.md)

## Install

```bash
#bun
bun add open-vector-tile
# pnpm
pnpm add open-vector-tile
# yarn
yarn add open-vector-tile
# npm
npm install open-vector-tile

# cargo
cargo install open-vector-tile
```

## Project Structure

</p>

## Example use

### Reading

```ts
const fs = from 'fs';
import { VectorTile } from 'open-vector-tile';

// assume you can read (.pbf | .mvt | .ovt)
const fixture = fs.readFileSync('./x-y-z.vector.pbf');
// Or load with bun:
const fixture = await Bun.file('./x-y-z.vector.pbf').arrayBuffer();
// load the protobuf parsing it directly
const tile = new VectorTile(fixture);

// VECTOR API:

// example layer
const { landuse } = tile.layers;

// grab the first feature
const firstFeature = landuse.feature(0);
// grab the geometry
const geometry = firstFeature.loadGeometry();

// OR specifically ask for a geometry type
const points = firstFeature.loadPoints();
const lines = firstFeature.loadLines();
const polys = firstFeature.loadPolys();

// If you want to take advantage of the pre-tessellated and indexed geometries
// and you're loading the data for a renderer, you can grab the pre-tessellated geometry
const [flatGeometry, indices] = firstFeature.loadGeometryFlat();

// IMAGE API

// example layer
const { satellite } = tile.images;
// grab the image data
const data = satellite.image(); // Uint8Array

// GRIDDED API

// example layer
const { elevation } = tile.grids;
// grab the grid data
const data = elevation.grid(); // number[]
```

### Writing

```ts
import { writeOVTile, writeMVTile } from 'open-vector-tile'

// Full support for 3D geometries, m-values, complex properties with nested objects, images, grids, etc.
const encodedData = writeOVTile(
  vectorTileData, // vector data
  images, // compressed images in specs like PNG, JPEG, etc.
  grids, // floating point grids like elevation, temperature, wind, precipitation, etc.
); // Uint8Array

// Write the older schema that's fast, light, with fewer feature sets
writeMVTile(
  vectorData,
  supportMabox // boolean decides if you want to support the old mapbox spec or have improved polygon support
); // Uint8Array
```

## General Purpose Information

### Layer Properties

```ts
type Extents = 512 | 1_024 | 2_048 | 4_096 | 8_192 | 16_384
interface Layer {
    // version control helps know what features are available
    version: number;
    // name of the layer
    name: string;
    // extent of the vector tile. MUST be one of `512`, `1024`, `2048`, `4096`, `8192`, or `16384`
    extent: Extents;
    // number of features in the layer
    length: number;
}
```

### Features

#### Feature Types

```ts
// 6 feature types in total plus the old MapboxVectorFeature
export type VectorFeature =
  // points may be a collection of points or single point
  | OVectorPointsFeature
  // lines may be a collection of lines or single line
  | OVectorLinesFeature
  // polygons may be a collection of polygons or single polygon
  | OVectorPolysFeature
  // 3D points may be a collection of 3D points or single 3D point
  | OVectorPoints3DFeature
  // 3D lines may be a collection of 3D lines or single 3D line
  | OVectorLines3DFeature
  // 3D polygons may be a collection of 3D polygons or single 3D polygon
  | OVectorPolys3DFeature
  // Can be any form of points, lines, or polygons without any of the new features
  // but all the functions. line offsets and bbox will always be defaults.
  | MapboxVectorFeature;
```

#### Feature Properties

```ts
type Extents = 512 | 1_024 | 2_048 | 4_096 | 8_192 | 16_384
interface Feature {
    // properties of the feature
    properties: any;
    // id of the feature
    id: number;
    // extent of the vector tile. MUST be one of `512`, `1_024`, `2_048`, `4_096`, `8_192`, or `16_384`
    extent: Extents;
}
```

#### Get the Feature's Bounding Box

```ts
export type BBox = [left: number, bottom: number, right: number, top: number];
export type BBox3D = [left: number, bottom: number, right: number, top: number, near: number, far: number];

const bbox: BBox | BBox3D = feature.bbox()
```

#### Pull in the geometry as a collection of points

```ts
// supported by all types, points, lines, and polygons
const geometry: Point[] | Point3D[] = feature.loadPoints()
```

#### Pull in the geometry as a collection of lines

```ts
// Supported by any line or polygon type
/// points will return an empty array
interface VectorLineWithOffset {
  /** the offset of the line to start processing the dash position */
  offset: number;
  /** the line data */
  geometry: VectorLine;
}
interface VectorLine3DWithOffset {
  /** the offset of the line to start processing the dash position */
  offset: number;
  /** the line data */
  geometry: VectorLine3D;
}
const geometry: VectorLineWithOffset[] | VectorLine3DWithOffset[] = feature.loadLines()
```

### Pull in the geometry relative to the type

```ts
const pointFeature: Point[] = (feature as OVectorPointsFeature).loadGeometry()
const lineFeature: VectorLine[] = (feature as OVectorLinesFeature).loadGeometry()
const polyFeature: VectorPoly[] = (feature as OVectorPolysFeature).loadGeometry()
const point3DFeature: Point3D[] = (feature as OVectorPoints3DFeature).loadGeometry()
const line3DFeature: VectorLine3D[] = (feature as OVectorLines3DFeature).loadGeometry()
const poly3DFeature: VectorPoly3D[] = (feature as OVectorPolys3DFeature).loadGeometry()
```

### If a Polygon type, Pull in the raw geometry with indices and tesselation data

```ts
// works for any polygon or polygon3D type.
// NOTE: If the indices is empty, then the geometry was never pre-earcut and you need to fallback to `loadGeometry` instead.
const geometry: [geometry: number[], indices: number[]] = feature.loadGeometryFlat()
```

### Creating and Validating your Shapes

Shapes define the type of data that can be stored in the vector tile. They are explained in the [specification](https://github.com/Open-S2/open-vector-tile/tree/master/vector-tile-spec/1.0.0#44-shapes).

If you'd like to validate the shape, feel free to use the [Ajv](https://github.com/epoberezkin/ajv) library.

```ts
import Ajv from 'ajv';
import { ShapeSchema } from 'open-vector-tile'; // Path to the schema

import type { Shape } from 'open-vector-tile';

const ajv = new Ajv();
const validate = ajv.compile(ShapeSchema);

const shape: Shape = {
  a: 'i64',
  b: ['string'],
  c: {
    d: 'f64',
    e: 'bool',
    f: 'null',
    g: 'f32',
    h: {
      i: 'u64',
    },
  },
};

validate(shape); // true
```

## Development

### Requirements

You need the tool `tarpaulin` to generate the coverage report. Install it using the following command:

```bash
cargo install cargo-tarpaulin
```

The `bacon coverage` tool is used to generate the coverage report. To utilize the [pycobertura](https://pypi.org/project/pycobertura/) package for a prettier coverage report, install it using the following command:

```bash
pip install pycobertura
```

### Running Tests

To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
# TYPESCRIPT
## basic test
bun run test
## live testing
bun run test:dev

# RUST
## basic test
cargo test
# live testing
bacon test
```

### Generating Coverage Report

To generate the coverage report, use the following command:

```bash
cargo tarpaulin
# faster
cargo tarpaulin --color always --skip-clean
# bacon
bacon coverage # or type `l` inside the tool
```
